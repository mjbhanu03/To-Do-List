# To-Do List Application

This is a **To-Do List** application built as a practice project using **React** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. The goal of this project is to learn and apply fundamental concepts of both React and Express.js, including API integration, state management, and CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Create** tasks with title and description.
- **Read** tasks from the database.
- **Update** existing tasks.
- **Delete** tasks.
- Simple **user interface** with real-time updates.
- Frontend and Backend communicate via **RESTful API**.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios (for API calls)
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing tasks)
- **Styling**: CSS (or you can use libraries like Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, etc.)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
